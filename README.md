# watchList-moviesApp

Technologies I used to create this project: Node.js, JavaScript, Html/Css, MongoDB, Ajax.
This Web App will help you find a movie that you want to watch now or in future, using OMDb API (The Open Movie Database) and add it to your Movie Watch List where you can keep it permanently
